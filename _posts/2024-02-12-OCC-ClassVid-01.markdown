It was a thrill to work with the FANUC robots during the labs of my industrial robotics class. I have been seeing these yellow robots since as far as I can remember. My dad worked at FANUC when I was born and my earliest memories of Christmas are receiving candy from a FANUC robot (what a scam it felt like - getting candy from the robot!:). However, it was in this class when I truly got under the hood of these fascinating machines. Controlling them with my code felt surreal at times.
Thoroughly enjoyed the class and learnt a lot as well.
