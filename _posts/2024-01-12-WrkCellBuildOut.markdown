In this step I experiment with different robot locations within the workcell to determine the optimal robot location. I used clamps to secure the robot to the base surface before deciding on a firm location. Among other things the two key key goals in placing the robot are:
The robot should be able to reach all the required positions for successful pick and place of produce items.
There should not be any interference between the robot and other components and peripherals on the work surface, either when the robot is stationary or when it is moving.
