One of my design guidelines in building out the workcell is to keep the working surface as free from interference as is possible. Cables are a common reason for interference in robotic workcells. Cables lying on the work surface is problematic as they can be hazardous if they get tangled-up in the robotic arm. My robot has two cables that need to connect to the controller box and I need to keep them off the work surface. I achieve this in this step by making a hole near the robot base to routing the Cables under The Table
