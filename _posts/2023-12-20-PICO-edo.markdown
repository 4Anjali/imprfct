The e-Do - one of the more affordable robotic arms from a large robotics firm. However, the e-do seems designed a lot for teaching robotics courses in class room settings. I’ve been eyeing this for a while for teaching robotics as part of my LIME Lab courses.
However for the food saver robotic workcell, I need a system that is flexible and open.
I really do need an open system so I can hack and tame it for my very specific need of sorting produce items.
Most critical it needs to be affordable. The FANUC robots would have been great , and I also know how to program them pretty well - thanks to the robotics class at OCC. However, I’ll need funds in the order of 50K range with the robot and peripherals etc.
Don’t have that kind of money unless my dad/team-coach funds it :)    Need to try out Go-fund me!
