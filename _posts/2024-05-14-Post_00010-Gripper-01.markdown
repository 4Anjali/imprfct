Bought this quiet compressor (60dB) from Menards for attaching to the vacuum gripper. Some coupling adaptors are needed since the pipe that came with the vacuum gripper has a 6 mm diameter and the tube that came with a compressor is ¼ inch. Could not find a coupler in stock in any of the stores. Even tried AutoZone since I was told automotive shops are big on air compressors.
Anyways, had to fall back on trusty Amazon.com and it was a breeze. I now need to put everything together and try it out. There is a concern around the solenoid or the 6 mm pipe blowing up on me due to air pressure. I am going to be extra careful before letting in any high pressure air through the vacuum gripper. I can’t afford any unnecessary and costly accidents. Might go for a smaller, lower pressure compressor. Fingers crossed.
