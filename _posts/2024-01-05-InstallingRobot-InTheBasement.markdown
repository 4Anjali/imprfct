Husky Saw Horses from the local Home Depot and a 3X4 Plywood board is what I have settled for mounting the robot. If this does not work out, I will try something different.
But I really love working with wood - it is such a gift for situations where you don’t know which turns you may have to take. With metal, you can’t even imagine such flexibility. With wood you can keep sawing, cutting, drilling holes, adding clamps etc. to your heart’s content. So Plywood it is for now!
