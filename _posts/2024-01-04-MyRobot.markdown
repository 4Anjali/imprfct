The robot has arrived. And I can’t wait to test out all the ideas. It’s one thing to have the AI algorithm working out. I think it is going to be whole new step forward to have the robotic workcell working.
The robotics class at OCC did give me the confidence that I can build out my own workcell. According to my sponsors with a smile(i.e. parents) it did not break the bank - but I am sure they had other uses for the money - so a Big Thanks!!  

Sidenote: Tweety is mostly excited about chewing the cardboard. As much as I would love to believe she knows what I am up to, I think all she cares about is being around me and talking to me - and that means the world :)!!
