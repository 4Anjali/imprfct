The robot has the mechanical arm and the controller. It is kind of interesting how having a different model than FANUC and having a more open system than FANUC helped bring together many of the ideas taught in the robotics class at the community college.

And of course I have Tweety to help me figure out this new robot - my unconditionally super-enthusiastic FanGirl :):):):).     Yay Go Anjali..you can do it !! :):).   

Sidenote: Tweety I think is really special - she is the most boujee bird I’ve ever come across. I think the birds in the trees outside are always trying to speak to her, get her attention, and talk to her - you know…like the challenges of celebrity life..:):)
