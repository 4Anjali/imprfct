### What
We started LIME Lab in Detroit in 2015, with the goal to provide pro-bono technology training to kids in the city of Detroit. In this almost decade of service, we have taught over 1200 girls in-person and reached thousands more through our outreach programs.

### Why
Prior to 2020, a substantial number of Detroit Public Schools Community District (DPSCD) students lacked access to personal computing devices and reliable internet at home. In response, the Connected Futures initiative was launched, providing devices and internet access to all DPSCD students.

In spite of such initiatives, in the 2023-24 school year, only 15.9% of students in grades 3-8 achieved proficiency in English Language Arts, and 11.0% in Math. (Source: NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS)

These statistics highlight the critical need for enhanced technology literacy programs and resources to support Detroit's students in being ready for careers in technology and STEM.
